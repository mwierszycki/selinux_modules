# SELinux module for Abaqus
SELinux policy module for Abaqus dedicated to block a possible malicious code execution via subroutines and Python scripts e.g. in cloud services or in Abaqus/CAE jobs.

Abaqus version: 2021 GA<br />
Distribution: Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.5 (Ootpa)

Still under development. Heavy testing required.

Feedback and contribution welcome!

[^1]: Intel OneAPI compilers labeled as `bin_t` type
[^2]: Remote only (with `-mesa`); use `set allow_abaqus_cae true` to enable 
[^3]: Scratch dir must be labeled as `tmp_t` type
[^4]: Python interpreter is confined strictly for Abaqus solvers execution (and GUI if enabled) - many other calls are intentionally blocked
